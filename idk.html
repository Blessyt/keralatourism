                    Idukki Arch Dam is an engineering marvel.It is an arch dam with a double curvature and is built on River 
                    Periyar. Precisely, the dam is constructed in a gorge between two hills, Kuravathi and Kuravan.
                    With this height, it is one of the highest arch dams in Asia. Because of its massive size, the dam 
                    can be seen from quite some distance and the sight of the structure in between the granite hills
                     is breathtaking. The surrounding is lush green, and the reservoir serves as a quick getaway for
                      locals.
